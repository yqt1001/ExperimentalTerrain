# ExperimentalTerrain
Ideally, this should be a pretty awesome terrain generator when I'm done. We'll see how it goes!
Popular demand dictated that I release somewhat regular videos during it's development, so this repository is split into branches showing progress based on episodes.
Could be compatible with all versions of Spigot following MC 1.2, depending on the blocks used. I don't see myself using any 1.9+ blocks.

## Installation
Uses Maven for dependency management. Clone the repository and package it into a usable jar with `mvn package`.
